# Isaac_Braccio
I couldn't find a .usd model of a tinkerkit Braccio so I decided to make one.

This used the CAD files from: https://github.com/ohlr/braccio_arduino_ros_rviz

The model articulation hasn't been controlled but can be spawned into Isaac Lab 

Feel free to use this model for your own projects :)
